Uses tokens without asking. 20+ ads to unlock 2-3 Ep's is ridiculous. Having 2 ads in place of 1 is dishonest. Ad's auto open to store or you have to close the same ad 2-3 times. X is deliberately smaller than appears so you open links instead of closing ads. Ads for PocketFM on other apps intentionally missrepresent stories.

I can live with that, as I only listen to it as an audiobook. Occasional inconsistencies in the plot and characters. I use the app for free and am happy to put up with 20 ads while I do the dishes. No one watches them, I hope. It's annoying, though, when two ads are shown in a competition block. In the end, it's not 20 ads, but 30, and that's just not acceptable."""

8:32,Pocket FM: Audio Series (Google Play),★☆☆☆☆ · by Chris Reeme · Negative,1,Chris Reeme,I love listening to this daily however the offers to complete task for coins is becoming more of a SCAM when they claim that they can't validate things just to get out of rewarding you for completing tasks. and yes they were on games that I have never played as well as they were downloaded through the offer page in the pocket FM app. the partners still want to claim that they can validate it even after I have provided screenshots of proof of completion.
