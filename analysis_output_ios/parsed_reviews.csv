2,1,Week 1,3047,LibertyTX2459!,1,Negative,,Monetization & Pricing;Content & UX,Too expensive / high coin cost;Subscription needed / request;AI voices / quality,Extremely Expensive much better options elsewhere!!! I am an avid audible listener I have been for many years now.  I have tried multiple options for platforms just to try them out.  What I have found with this platform is the price is astronomically high.  It’s not an upfront cost it’s the over time that gets you a cut but a thousand knives if you will.  For example the one book I have made it through half of so far even with the discounts has cost me 50 dollars and by the way I am doing the math if I keep my normal listening pace is most likely going to cost me an additional hundred dollars.  Now granted the book I am on is probably a three part series but that still doesn’t offset the enormous cost.  What they do is they sell you coins and give you a couple of free samples then in the evening they charge you coins to continue listening and it averages out to about ten coins every 7 to 8 minutes.  Not all times are I have paid all the way up to 29 coins for ten minutes of listening time.  I would much rather just buy a book no hidden cost no hidden fees just buy and own.  I currently and have been using audible since 2009 and it is a good app and I would and have suggested this app but never stop paying for your subscription because if you do all the books you have bought will be gone.  Plus they don’t have the background music like in the modern books and it does take a while to bring out the next book. If you are looking for an app that makes your feel like you are in a movie try sound booth theatre it’s a great app just not a big selection.  Overall like I have said I have tried many of them I still maintain my audible account and as soon as I finish this book I will make another post saying exactly how much it cost for an avid listener to listen to one book.  Stay tuned I will be back lol.

At first, they entice you with free coins and easy access, but once you’re hooked on a story, the costs skyrocket.The coin system is deliberately convoluted. On average, 10 coins only gets you about 10 minutes of content, and with thousands of short episodes, the price adds up insanely fast. I found myself spending $30–$40 a day just to keep listening. That’s not financially responsible or feasible for anyone long-term.To finish a single novel, you could easily spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Meanwhile, a real audiobook of the same length would cost only a fraction of that. The pricing here feels deceptive, unsustainable, and borderline scammy.I’m extremely disappointed.

The ability to write your own audiobooks and bring your story to life with customizable AI narration and background music is truly amazing.The content on the platform is top-notch exciting, diverse, and always leaves you wanting more.The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the coin system. After getting hooked on a story, you only get about 5 free episodes before you’re required to use coins to continue. It starts off requiring 1–5 coins per episode but quickly ramps up to 10 coins per episode. If you’re not keeping track, it can get expensive fast.I completely understand the need to monetize, and I don’t mind paying for good content but it would be fantastic if there were a monthly subscription option that offered a flat rate or allowed access to more episodes beyond the daily free ones. Or even a flat rate to purchase the whole series!  That would make the experience more accessible and enjoyable for binge listeners like me.Finally, I want to say that this app is incredibly entertaining and creative. One idea for future updates could be the addition of animated, AI-generated videos or images especially with characters whose mouths move in sync with the narration. Something similar to what’s often shown in TikTok ads. While I usually just listen now, I really enjoyed the visuals early on in the series. They helped paint a vivid picture of the characters and setting, which made the story feel even more immersive instead of leaving everything up to imagination.Great job with the app.  I will most definitely continue to be an active part of the community.

The stories are addictive & amazing! HOWEVER if Pocket FM does not urgently reconsider their marketing strategies when it comes to how consumers are spending their money for these audio stories, I can guarantee you that they will not be around long. For Pocket FM to literally have consumers spend hundreds of dollars on Pocket Coins and then also, risk identity theft through many third party promotional app companies (many, that are not even legit) in order for consumers to retrieve free Pocket Coins (did I mention that it’s not even guaranteed that you will receive those free Pocket Coins?!), is urgently an inconvenience to consumers and eventually this will result in Pocket FM facing consequences financially, when it comes to consumer engagement. There’s absolutely no way in the world that they are refusing considering creating monthly membership packages for consumers to purchase in order to upkeep consumer engagements (unfortunately this is true at this time). It comes off on the organization’s behalf as selfish and them being money hungry. Again; it’s a huge inconvenience to the consumers who are utilizing their services. You can barely enjoy the services at an affordable price without consistently having to pay for pocket coins every other hour!? If Pocket FM doesn’t reconsider AFFORDABLE MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP PACKAGES (with perks included), in the long run they will perish! I’d hate to see because it is a great app but LOGICAL/SENSIBLE, FAIR (AFFORDABLE) AND REASONABLE marketing strategies will need to change if they’re going to be around! It’s a must! 4.5 stars for the app overall. I may reconsider changing this review depending on if the CEO sees my review and actually cares to do something about it soon.Another thing: I have two accounts with you guys; I’ve noticed how one account Pocket Coin packages differs from the other. If you’re going to be anything, U urge you to please refrain from being disloyal to your customers per various accounts. There’s absolutely no way that those Pocket Coin packages should differ in pricing and in quality whatsoever! It’s literally every time you pay for Pocket Coins, that the Pocket Coin packages immediately generate both in quantity and in pricing, resulting in a huge inconvenience.

Generally it tells you the next couple of free episodes are available in 24 hours and the next set in 48 hours. The timer does not function correctly. I try to listen to my story every day at the same time however, like today, I have to wait an additional 12 hours and even then I am not sure if it will be available. I have bought coins before but the story I like to listen to eats up coins very quickly. I can afford that. I even tried to save some episodes to listen to for a long trip I took and figured they would be available when I drove. They were not.

That’s a very greedy approach and makes the app feel more like a money trap than an entertainment platform.Please rethink this model.
