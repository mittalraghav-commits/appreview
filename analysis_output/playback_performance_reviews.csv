Uses tokens without asking. 20+ ads to unlock 2-3 Ep's is ridiculous. Having 2 ads in place of 1 is dishonest. Ad's auto open to store or you have to close the same ad 2-3 times.

Theoretically, the content belongs to the users themselves, and they still charge for the stories. Then the app crashes, and a series I was watching rewinds the five episodes I had unlocked, and now they're locked while I was watching another series. I like the way it's set up, but I don't like that the app's sole purpose is to pay with microcoins, which don't show the actual price so you don't realize how much you're paying."""

At first, I could listen to five episodes a day, which was about 45 minutes a day. Now I only get one episode a day. Each additional episode costs me between 8 and 12 coins, each for about 10 minutes. One day, I had the opportunity to earn coins from advertising videos, but that doesn't work for me anymore either.

I noticed that my app keeps pausing and only continues playing when I open it, which makes no sense. It was so bad that I thought I had bad internet, but it was just your app. I like listening to the stories like Vampire System and others, but I won't listen to this app if I can't even multitask like I used to before this update."""
27,4,Week 4,8944,Bae bae,1,Negative,English,Monetization & Pricing;Playback & Performance;Content & UX,Ads gating / too many ads;Offline / download issues;AI voices / quality,everyone should be careful with this app it has a free episode every 48 hours and gives you option to unlock more with payments or watching ads. but when you get to certain part in the story it just plays ads in the screen instead of the story so it's making you look at ads when your not getting anything for them. so I advise everyone to not download
