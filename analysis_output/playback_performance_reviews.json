Customer Support has been useless in helping with the issue to ensure I receive my rewards. What they advertise on the Offer Wall is a joke. Be prepared to fight with them to get what's advertised most of the time. Don't bother with this app. Cost too many coins for 6 to 10 min segments."

But the pricing model is too expensive: 800 coins = €49.99, which can easily add up to €400–€700 for long series.

Added to that are episode repetitions and inappropriate music or images (see other reviews): When listening in the car, the app skips back several episodes after a pause. Unfortunately, all the bugs and price drops only become apparent after extended use.\""
