Uses tokens without asking. 20+ ads to unlock 2-3 Ep's is ridiculous. Having 2 ads in place of 1 is dishonest. Ad's auto open to store or you have to close the same ad 2-3 times. X is deliberately smaller than appears so you open links instead of closing ads. Ads for PocketFM on other apps intentionally missrepresent stories."

I purchase coins to listen to the stories I follow, NOT the ones that are automatically started without my permission. as well as setting sleep timer and all stories do not stop. I set timer because I know I may fall asleep. I wake up and my battery is dying, amd my coins are gone. when I finish the stories I am into I will delete this app. very disappointed\""
