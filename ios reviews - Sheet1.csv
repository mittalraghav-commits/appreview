The app is good but the support is very terrible
The support is very terrible. They won’t reply or attend to ur queries or problems. This is one of the worst ever customer support I’ve ever encountered. My unlocked episode got locked again. When I reported no action was taken till I have to repurchase the same episodes.  The stories are good but the support is the worst.

Not to bad
I like this app except I wish I had more photos to go along. Also don’t know why but it keeps taking me back to episode one when I’m on episode 300 plus.

★★★★☆ · by Jsaher · Positive
Good but has a few flaws
The stories are nice some of them just drag on too long and have no direction or they lose direction. Sometimes stories which are really interesting and abruptly especially the one about the princess Dr Princess. About Eleanor and James it was such a beautiful story and they just abruptly ended it so I like the app and I can continue to listen to some of the stories but there’s needs to be some sort of comprehensive ending and beginning story track lines.

Fesselnde Storys
Die Storys sind echt fesselnd . Man würde gerne länger hören ohne coins kaufen zu müssen. Schade das man das Buch nicht auf einmal kaufen oder ein Abo abschließen kann.

"I wish there was a way stop playing a different in the audiobook. Oh you don’t have enough coin to finish this. Let’s play a Totally different one people say there’s a way, but I don’t see it I wish it would just end. It won’t play nothing else, but I can’t find it and I wish they would add one that won’t  play a different audio series listen that one. I don’t wanna listen to this one a.k.a. don’t care about any other audio service at this time. well, I hope you can understand what I’m saying. I’m not very good at this if there is a way.

Overpriced! stay away
Heard a ad and decided to give the app a try. Listened for a while for free than i hit the pay wall. And not just any pay wall… it continues to get worse. I would spend some coin if I could continue to listen but what they are charging is ridiculous. I cant imagine how much it would cost to listen to a whole series. I have decided to bail on the story and go elsewhere. Fix your broken greedy coin system.

Can’t change email
"You can’t update your email tied to the account. Instead, you need to make a new account and customer service will transfer your old progress to the new account….or at least that’s what the help articles claim. Instead you’ll make a new account and contact customer service. Then you’ll be met with a generic email promising that the account transfer will occur. It never does. You reach out a dozen times over two weeks and each time you are promised the transfer will happen the same day. It never does. All your previous progress will be lost forever."

My vampire system
If you downloaded this app specifically for this audio/slide show series then don’t do it.  E1717 is when the slide vids stop and they leave you hanging.  No spoilers here just know it’s a let down not to see images this close to the end of the story.
Now the app itself has been shaky at times.  Bugs are in all apps to a certain degree. They are working on then with patches.  So just be mindful as to why you want to download this app.
If the slide vids appear I will (if able) adjust my review to a more positive one.

While I love the stories I find it very unfair that if I listen to a ton of commercials or pay for extra  chapters that you loose the free chapters for the next day. I’m listening to a book and now the next free chapters is a week out due to me buying extra chapters. (The Dukes Masked Bride) seems you’d guys would fix this.Otherwise enjoying the app.

I think the pocket coins are a bit expensive  much rather a premium rate $20 month say for 10 free episodes a day but if I was to pay for 1story in pocket coins  one story is over 2000 episodes that’s too
"Much money I can buy a hard cover book for far less. You need either TV a premium rate or make pocket coins s about triple the amount per dollar  15 coins per 1,99 is way to high so I slowed down not buying many"

To many ads
There are way to many ads and their isn’t even an option to pay to remove them and some ads are super long being a whole podcast long. Seems like lately every two chapters I am getting super long ads. And if I skip the ad it gives me another ad next chapter. I got this so I can listen to something at work or while I did house work. I can’t just stop what I am doing just to skip an ad . It’s super annoying

Love the story. Just wish the ads weren’t so many and so long. At least one can listen to to the story for a lot of chapters but hate it when it takes weeks for new chapters to open up. I read The Masked Bride and had to wait months for the second series to open up. As a result I lost interest in the story and switched to another app which I could read constantly. I only read stories that have the completed story. I don’t read stories that I have to pay for. When I download an app and it asks me for my email I am scared money will get taken off my phone. I then skip the app.

I like this app a lot. I love the new update too on how you could rewind or fast forward 10 seconds even from the Lock Screen. My only thing is they should give more coins with the packages. These series are already SO LONG. The least yall could do is offer more coins to make us wanna buy them. It’s almost a rip off though smh. Other than that app is great!

Costs way too much and greedy
"Watched the pocket fm YouTube because I got impatient, I left off on  episode 201 and made it to 271… when I went to try to buy episode 271, it only allows me to buy all the episodes in between which would cost about $83.97(tax not included). This is a 2000+ series by the way."

"Pocket FM: Audio Series is very entertaining and addictive as, as soon as you listen to an audio book or anything. You’ll immediately want to continue listening or watching non stop.  Even though sometimes they might be some issues.  But pocket fm is always the right way to go if you want something that will make you want to come back for moreOverall I rate the app 5:5 as it is amazing and I think anyone who wants to try, should try"

Mandatory ads
This use to be a great app that I enjoyed listening to while at work but ever since the mandatory ads started I can’t enjoy any stories while driving at work. If something doesn’t change I’ll just have to uninstall this app and find something else to enjoy. The ads are beyond excessive and doesn’t automatically continue the series so you have to always go back on your phone every couple minutes to hit the x on the ad to keep it playing

The Royal Accident
I love the book and hope that they make it into a drama movie one day.(Food For Thought) The only thing is that I wish I didn’t have to pay so much to continue reading the chapters because it takes so long to watch free episodes. I’ve spent over $80 in the last 14 hrs just to continue to listen to this book and other series on Pocket FM. I spend so much to listen to these books it’s like I’m paying a utility bill every month. My only suggestion is PLEASE MAKE PURCHASING THE COINS MORE AFFORDABLE OR EVEN HAVE MONTHLY OR EVEN WEEKLY PACKAGES FOR US TO PURCHASE SO WE CAN LISTEN TO ALL BOOKS ON THIS SITE.

Robbery
I just recently started listening to pocket FM. And I was thoroughly enjoying the story that I was listening to. Which is why I gave two stars. But it seems like I’m getting less coins for the money I spend and the episodes are costing more.  Right now I’m looking ahead and the episodes are 25 coins. That’s almost 5 dollars an episode.  This is outrageous. How can anybody charge that and sleep at night?

Like the App .It can get pricey if you don’t want to wait for the free  chapters . When I first got this App they offered an option for a year subscription to have unlimited access  Loved it loved the stories but when the year was up they discontinued that option. I was disappointed that happened it really slowed my usage of  Pocket fm because of the amount off money I was spending to finish a story bring back the year subscription.

I am getting frustrated now with this app. I like the idea that we wait 24 hr to get a new episode. However when the 24 hour is completed there is no new episode and the time expand. I have been waiting over 2 weeks now to continue listening to an interesting story. I need to find another app. Very disappointing

Pocket FM
Too many ads and podcasts. Ads are ok if they were less then a minute but when you have them longer then the story time or as frequently as two in within 10mins then that’s agitating. Also some (ads) are really podcasts (30mins or more long). Also it’s money hungry. If you spend you money on this app then please be aware that it’s designed to spend all of it in one go.

"I truly enjoy listening to the stories on this app. I’m so happy they added a check in to receive some coins. But what I’d really love for them to do is a monthly subscription so we can listen to stories all the way through. I’ve bought coins to continue stories but it’s never enough to truly put a dent in the story. I have 3 stories in rotation that all have over 2,000 chapters and I get so sad having to wait 48hours for the next few chapters."

Anonymus und quälende Musik
"Die Entwickler sind nicht fähig die Namen der Kommentatoren anzuzeigen sondern alle Kommentare werden unter „Anonymus“ veröffentlicht. Das Problem besteht schon seit Monaten, aber nichts wird getan."
"Stattdessen hat irgendjemand beschlossen in allen  Episoden  nervtötende Musik im Hintergrund laufen zu lassen. Die Proteste der Zuhörer, und die Bitten die Musik und das Geklimper abzustellen werden völlig ignoriert. Die Musik ist zT so laut wie die Erzählungen, so das es schwierig ist der Geschichten zu folgen. Schade! Das ist wie der optimistische Liebhaber der am Ende „Na, wie war ich?“ tönt"

Anonymous and tormenting music
"The developers are unable to display the names of commenters; all comments are published under ""Anonymous."" This problem has existed for months, but nothing has been done."
"Instead, someone decided to play annoying music in the background throughout all episodes. Listeners' protests and requests to turn the music and tinkling down are completely ignored. The music is sometimes as loud as the narration, making it difficult to follow the story. What a pity! It's like the optimistic lover who says, ""So, how was I?"" at the end"

Cranky
"While the app itself isn’t exactly user-friendly. It isn’t overly complicated either. However, if you have a problem with a story or the app functionality , do not email them. Instead of fixing it, they will either reset your account entirely and good luck finding the stories that you had wanted to listen to And you will have to re-wait and or listen to the entirety of the stories that you are most likely 700 to 800 episodes into from scratch!!! My main problem was after you get done listening to the free episodes for the day. It will switch to another story most likely a random story And while sometimes you can find a diamond in the rough by listening to random stories you cannot get them off of your library. Once it is been listened to a story goes onto your library you cannot remove it, even by pressing the take this and or remove this from my library button as that does not work. I also had a question about why certain stories certain amounts of episodes and other stories like a completely different amount of episode per day. The length of the story or the amount of minutes in that episode do not seem to matter in how many unlock. I had one for example unlock eight episodes every 72 hours while technically getting two free episodes I asked why this happened and was reset to one episode a day after that effectively halfing the amount of episodes that I was able to listen to. In essence, the solution might be worse than the problem."

"This platform is a rip off and you should see how many complaints are on other platforms. You end up spending a fortune in whatever story you are listening to. They give you coins for listening but the coins only get you a few episodes. Check out various complaints boards. Also, their pricing policies are not clearly communicated. There are a lot of high fives, until people see how much they end up spending."

"Would rate this app 5 stars but unless I pay (which I have now) or wait 3 days at a time you basically can’t listen to an episode of a book you’re listening too. The time for a new episode late into a book is absurd, at least the prices for the episode are always somehow on a sale! Also change the Shop for IOS, I dislike how many options there are, and how expensive they are, Used to pay $120 for like 1200 coins now that will only get me like 800?"

"Total bait and switch. To listen to say “My Vampire system” it would cost a thousand dollars. In what world is an audiobook with an AI voice worth a thousand dollars? App will let you listen to 70 chapters free to hook you. It’ll cost 40 dollars a day to listen for more than the free 5 (5-10 minute) chapters. Oh and there’s 2200 chapters… So to actually listen to anything, say while you’re working, it will cost you over 40 dollars per day for over 3 months or 330+ hours. Shouldn’t even be legal."

My review
"It’s a good little app limits the amount of binging you can do which is good for me anyway. Can also just listen to multiple per day since it’s 4 episodes per story per day. Besides the little bugs that happen and start causing you to only get 3 or 2 or 1 wepsioxe a day there’s really no other issues, writing’s sometimes irritating but that’s not the apps fault. Voice sometimes doesn’t fit properly but I can ignore it for the most part"

"In the past it used to offer me watch a video to unlock a new episode, but here recently I just been only getting watch 8 ads to unlock 1 episode or 24 ads to unlock 3. Why do I have to watch so many ads just for so little episodes now? How can I get it to watch less videos and unlock more episodes again?"

Amazing stories but premium should be easier to get to
I’ve been scouring the internet to find how to obtain premium bc purchasing the coin is quite frustrating and doing the math I’ll be spending well over $50 just to finish this one story I’ve spent the past week listening and reading along but a premium option would be nice to have

I’ve got two problems that are minor
I really like the app it has great stories and is a great way for me to pass the time. The only problems I’m having might be a little selfish because one is the fact that it takes 2 days to unlock like 4 episodes and the other is that I’m not sure if some of the stories use an AI voice but if they do it would be nice if you could make a way for the readers to change the voice but also have the original voice listed for people who like the original voice the author used. That is all I have to say I may be wrong about a lot of this but it’s always good to give suggestions even if it’s a stupid one. Please and thank you.

Click bait
"I was on youtube and saw an ad for My Vampire System where he fights Troy at the beginning. interested in what happens next (ad said to download the app to know), I downloaded the app and the story isn’t even close to being real. This company uses click bait to get people in and I have deleted this app for that specific reason. If you’re gonna hook people in with a good story, make sure it’s a real story instead of completely changing someone else’s work to click bait people into downloading."

Anonymus und quälende Musik
"Die Entwickler sind nicht fähig die Namen der Kommentatoren anzuzeigen sondern alle Kommentare werden unter „Anonymus“ veröffentlicht. Das Problem besteht schon seit Monaten, aber nichts wird getan."
"Stattdessen hat irgendjemand beschlossen in allen  Episoden  nervtötende Musik im Hintergrund laufen zu lassen. Die Proteste der Zuhörer, und die Bitten die Musik und das Geklimper abzustellen werden völlig ignoriert. Die Musik ist zT so laut wie die Erzählungen, so das es schwierig ist der Geschichten zu folgen. Schade! Das ist wie der optimistisch-dreiste Liebhaber der am Ende „Na, wie war ich?“ tönt"

"Instead, someone decided to play annoying music in the background throughout all episodes. Listeners' protests and requests to turn the music and tinkling down are completely ignored. The music is sometimes as loud as the narration, making it difficult to follow the story. What a pity! It's like the optimistic, cheeky lover who says, ""So, how was I?"" at the end"

Some good stories
"While the stories are great for the most part the watch ads to unlock more can be tricky. If you start to watch ads, sometimes it will say 12 more ads to listen to 2 more episodes and then the number will go up after the first or second ad. Other times if you say watch 12 episodes of the 17 needed to unlock 2, if you leave and come back after the evening reset to 1 for 1, then you just watched ads for nothing. Also some ads are 5 seconds(rare) and others are 2 minutes +."

Disgusting YouTube Ads
"I cannot count the number of sexually explicit, gruesome , misogynistic and offensive ads that I’ve seen on my YouTube. Sometimes my daughter has my phone and I have to rip it away from her when one of your hideous advertisements comes on. I have blocked and reported every single one I see, but they keep appearing. Fix your YouTube ads, and figure out how to get to your audience without using the lowest common denominator. Not everyone is desensitized to rape, sexual assault and evil like you are."

Great app great stories just small discrepancy
So the app itself is great and the stories I’m listening too are actually really good the only issue I have is the waiting part to unlock new episodes and the fact there is no way around it god forbid I buy some tokens wich in guilty of because I’m dying to know what happens next on my vampire system (highly recommend)if you earn or buy coins when you get ahead on episodes instead of the wait being the next few hours or within 24 hours they end up jumping from a few hours essentially the next day to 48 hour wait for like 2 or 3 episodes and one other thing that kinda has me reluctant to buy anymore coins is the prices and the price itself isn’t bad but what ruins buying coins is before buying coins episodes are one coin to unlock and further down they may say 2 coins to unlock but as you start to unlock episodes you end up depleting your coins super fast because outta nowhere after a few episodes for one or two coins as you progress episodes jump to being 5 coins 7 coins per unlock of a episode and that is what ruins buying coins no bang for your buck what you end up paying 50$ worth in coins can be earned doing tasks in a matter of a hour or two just grinding tasks and even then after earring all those coins they are gone that very same day if they didn’t raise the wait time and amount of coins to unlock episodes I’d be more likely to just buy the coins instead of wasting my time doing tasks it either then that this is a great app

Pocket FM audio
I enjoy the story I’m listening to however it’s not what I was expecting. You only get a few chapters of a story and then you have to listen to ads which still give you one or 2 more chapters. The other option is to BUY COINS!! They can add up. Of courses the more coins you buy the more chapters you can listen to. So far I’ve spent over $50. and I’m still not done with this one audio story. I could have bought several books for that amount of money. Because I want to know how the story ends I will continue. BUT BEST BE ASSURED I’m DELETING THIS  APP AFTERWARDS!!

"Was 5 star, now won’t play through my AirPods"
"I’m autistic and I love this app because it has a limit to how much you can listen to at one time. Each time my time is up it reminds me to get up and stretch my legs and then refocus on MWork before I play the next one. Now all of a sudden, I can’t play the story through my AirPods, even though my AirPods still work in other apps. The only thing I can think of is that since this app was updated, it interfered with the functioning of my AirPods. Please fix this so I don’t have to stop using the app."

Anfangs gibt es einen Film, dann sind es nur noch Bilder, dann andere oder fiktive Personen auf den Bildern… bei Noras Geheimnis irgendwann gar keine Bilder mehr und bei Das Model und der Millionär sind diese unecht und teilweise echt hässlich. Ich finde, man sollte wenigstens bei den gleichen Models bleiben."
Luft nach oben :)
-------------------
English Translation
Quality decreases
"Unfortunately, the stories are far-fetched. There's a film at the beginning, then it's just pictures, then other or fictional people in the pictures... In Nora's Secret, at some point there are no pictures at all, and in The Model and the Millionaire, the pictures are fake and sometimes really ugly. I think they should at least stick with the same models."
Room for improvement :)

Don’t bother downloading
"The audiobooks are great don’t get me wrong,but the amount of ads is overwhelming. You can tell the creators of the app are just money hungry. To unlock 2 episodes you need to watch 26 advertisements. Sure you get 18 mins of free playtime a day but then you watch advertisements to unlock more. Coins are extortionate as well, to unlock one 9 minute episode it’s £1.50. Unless you want to watch 30 minutes of adverts for 18 minutes of playtime don’t bother downloading. Once over finished this audiobook I’m deleting the app!"

Scam sell your identity for coins
The coin system and made it based on streaks so you get less episodes and the coins they offer you on the third day or not 25 they lieAnd they offer ways to get free coins but they ask for personal identity information to get coins and their legal notice states they are not responsible for what third parties do with you info.

Too much spam
"I have ""blocked"" no less than 100 cheap AI generated ads on Youtube in just the last 2 weeks after having to listen to over 200 versions of the same stupid vampire story."
"I cringe now when I have to hear the endless ads or the names of the characters they actively shove down my throat. If they were actually successful, they wouldn't need to spam people to read their garbage."
"Good stories are shared by PEOPLE, not discount garbage ads. I cant condone a product that has turned into more harassment than entertainment."

Do NOT bother
"I’m sure that the majority of you installed this app after hearing an hour’s long ad on whatever platform, but please DON’T waste your time on this app!"
"What you hear on the ad is a COMPLETE different version of the story on here! Especially after Chapter 10/11! It’ll completely change the narrator, details of the story, and the storyline!"
"I had to stop listening to The Alpha’s Bride on here, because the ENTIRE story changed! Talia’s hair went from going completely silver to copper, Marcy (Alpha’s daughter) was undoing Alpha Damon’s buckle to her “pleasuring him,” Alpha Damon recognizing that Talia was his mate from when he sniffed her and the Alpha’s guards ran up to them, then Alpha Edward (Talia’s tormentor) started a fight with Alpha Damon, and this is where I stopped listening to the story on this app!! The narrator is a borish narrator, and this female narrator does ALL the voices of the characters!"
Please DON’T waste your time installing this app!!
Uninstalling IMMEDIATELY!!!

A scam?
"The stories are pretty good. Needs better grammar and closed captioning. You can supposedly get free episodes y doing surveys but that appears to be a scam. You can sopposedly do as many surveys as you want and earn pin to unlock more of the stories, but they cheat you out of the and award them to you. Plus they let you listen to several of the episodes just to get you “hooked” and then cut them drastically down to get you to purchase coins in which you can quickly run up a tab into the $$hundreds of dollars."

Scam don’t waste time and $.
They charge so much to buy coins and that changes every time.  Use to be able to get so many episodes every 24 hour now’s it’s changed to 48 hours.  It will take me over a year to get to listen to entire episode even buying coins. I can listen to audio books way cheaper!   I also notice they respond to those that give high marks but pretty much ignore any low marks. Don’t waste your time and $.

"Good selection of stories, only downside is the adds are not what happen in a lot of the stories, a lot of AI is used in them and little details will sometimes flip flop in different chapters but for a free app, and free stories (as long as you have enough patience to wait for chapters to unlock), it is a fun way to pass the time."

Inconsistent
"While I do enjoy the app, I can only enjoy in batches. I have unlocked so many episodes and it will be there one minute and if I go back in an hour it tells me it’s not available until the next day. I strategically unlocked hundreds of episodes without listening to the story, one day when I was about half way through the unlocked episodes, I logged out. When I came back it said what was once unlocked wasn’t available until 48 hours. That’s also another issue, it will tell you anywhere from 10 hours and then will change to 48. It is not fair that the app is inconsistent and the efforts people put in are taking away. Once I finish the series I have already started, which seems like it’ll take another 6 months, I will be deleting the app. It’s not worth it the little bit of episodes they allot a day will make it take at least 3-6 months to finish a series if you don’t want to spend for coins."

expensive and needs polishing
app uses your coins -without asking- to continue listening.
stories seem like they could be generated/ influenced by AI and cost upward of 30 dollars because you can only buy individual episodes. the scam is to get you to do surveys for coins which are priced at 20$ per 400 coins and thousands of episodes per series

Unfortunately, I have been listening to it for the last 56 days straight and put over hundreds of dollars into the book and haven’t been able to finish it. The coins are way too expensive. I would rather buy the book for $100 then keep paying money for coins every day that’s ridiculous. But for real, I’ll check out the audio my vampire system.

Don’t waste your time
"They let you listen to a little each day for free but if you buy coins or listen to commercials then the freebies go away for 48 hours. The commercials used to be tolerable but now they use all kinds of tricks to keep you trapped in ads (for coins to listen) and now the ads have gone from being semi tolerable to extremely long and occasionally inescapable (with no way exit, arrrg!!!) Do yourself a favor and use an app that has a subscription service or is free through your local library.I hate being taken hostage by the current system; unfortunately, I got hooked on some of their stories so it’s tough to walk away.Play it smart and don’t get hooked here. You’ll be the better for it."

They steal your coins be very careful This has happened to me twice once with 350 and once with 409
"They never respond to you about your missing coins. They’re just hope that you keep going. Keep buying keep looking at videos and keep listening and let your coins keep disappearing You are a cricket, cricket and sneaky and deceitful I talk to my sister last night because she’s sick and she needed to talk about her procedure so I set up and did a lot of videos last night. I had 409 videos when I went to sleep so now I’m going to take a picture of my videos and I’m going to post them on your website. This is the second time it happened to me and evidently you don’t care. I started turning off your website to make sure that nothing happens I don’t know how this is happening. I am at the end of the Duke and the bride. I am almost at the end of the millionaire accidental bride. I can’t watch anymore. Duke and I only can watch the accidental bride unless I give up points. I turn my iPad off so it doesn’t play. This is the second time this happens to me last time you took 350 coins from me this time you took 409 for me I went to bed at four something this morning, I turned off my device so if my device is turned off, how in the heck can I have zero coins so I’m gonna give you one more chance and I truthfully hope that people stop listening to you because I know I’m not the only one that this is happening to you don’t care if it happens to me again I’ll just read a book. I enjoy these two pocket FM but they’re not worth it dealing with somebody who is deceitful and not honest. I like honest people I don’t like sneaky people I told you about the 350 you didn’t care now 409 coins and my devices are turned off and you do not care you don’t care about your listeners. I tell people about you. I would never tell anybody about your pocket FM ever again and I will report this to Apple as well and I’m trying to find a way to rate you all as a zero as a cheater as a dishonest pocket FM."

"Great stories, decent app, annoying unlocking system and ads"
"TLDR, the stories and readers are great and fun to listen to, the app has some plus sides and is relatively easy to use, but the unlocking system for accessing content leaves room to be desired. Make it so it only costs 1 ad per episode and we can unlock them unlimited and I’ll change to 5 stars.Pros:"
-The stories and narrator voices are pretty good. And there are a ton of them!
-You can easily pre download episodes if going into areas with no wifi or cell signal.
-You can pre watch ads to unlock episodes (unfortunately not unlimited) or earn coins for uninterrupted listening unlike YouTube which throws ads in randomly throughout their content.
"-I like the new streak system of earning coins. Though the coins don’t go very far, the little freebies are appreciated."
-You can read other users thoughts and reviews on each story and each episode.Cons:
-I HATE that I can’t continually listen to one story at a time without waiting a week or two for enough episodes to unlock to be worth listening to. I want more than 2-4 episodes a day. I would totally be fine with watching 1 ad per episode as long as I had the unlimited option to unlock them as needed.
-21 ads to unlock 3 episodes? Seriously devs? And why the daily limit even if I wanted to waste my time watching that many ads?
-Coins are way overpriced. I can buy an entire audiobook for $40 and get 10-14 hours of listening time. $60 worth of coins on this app only gets you about 3 hours. NOT WORTH IT!
"-YouTube has spoiled us with being able to easily skip ads. Though theirs annoyingly pop up throughout their content, and yours thankfully don’t, your ads are annoyingly harder to get through. Your ads don’t auto end, they take constant management with needing to close out of multiple popups before moving on to the next one. Plus the “X” button is so tiny it’s almost like a mini game itself just to close out of the goofy thing."

Not what is advertised
"I get stuck listening to these commercials when I’m working, and started to get hooked on one of the stories."
"So I downloaded the app and started listening to the story that was advertised. Then I quickly realized that the narrator(s) in the commercials is way better then what the application gives us. In the commercials we get several different voice actors for different characters in the story. But in the app, it’s just one voice, changing its tone for different characters. Sounds so cheesy, like a librarian is reading a book to a grade school class. So disappointing."

or
"1 (90 second) add for 1 coin so,"
"25 minutes of add watching to listen to 1 episode shorter then the time you watched adds to listen to it.Books with thousands of episodes, you do the math!Thousands of adds or dollars to listen to 1 book, absolutely disgusting.Been listening to 6 different books for over a year and haven’t finished a single one.I refuse to buy coins but I have watched thousands of adds for “free episodes “"
Still have yet to finish a book.Absolutely 100% Greedy developers
I recommend staying far far away it’s pure evil trash garbage greedUpdate:
I finally finished a book after 1 year and 2300 adds
"Do not download this appSo the longer you listen to a book, the more expensive it becomes to unlock new content, they go from 1-3 adds per chapter to 3-6 adds to 6-9 adds per episode.I’m currently listening to 5 stories and watch about 200-300 adds a day just for “free content “"
"Currently 24 adds unlocks 3 episodes at 12-15 minutes per episode.Most of the books I’m listening to have 2000 + episodes and I’m about 200-300 episodes in after 6 months after watching thousands of adds………..The coin paywall is a joke, literally thousands of $$$$ to unlock just 1 book. That’s insane."
"I can buy an audiobook for 10-20$ and not have any adds on audioable but your telling me I need to spend thousands to listen to a story on this app?????If you don’t mind grinding adds for minutes then go for it but keep your hard earned money in your wallet and don’t buy coins.I’m over a year into this app and have only finished 1 book “ My Opulent System” the book ended horribly because the Author was going to make a second book but the app cancelled the authors second book because of “negative feedback “ so that was a year of waisted time.I started the app on my vampire system because of a You tube video that got me but the story got real boring around episodes 400 and I quit listening with 2000 to go.Currently listening to Jacks Retribution “ love it” but episodes just went up to 4-6 adds per episode at around 200th and they have 2442 episodesMy Dragon Princess is now 7-9 episodes per chapter around 250th  with 896 chaptersSupreme Magus got hella boring so dropped itSuper Gene is good but just got more expensive after 200th and they have 2000 episodesMind you buying coins is a rip off and 1 add is 1 coin and 800 coins is 100$$$$ so………Thousands of $$$$$ to listen to a story add free.I’d rather waist my life watching adds then spend $$$$$$$ either way I hate this app and the people who run it and it will disappear off my  [review truncated, click ""view"" below to see full content]"

I like
"I like listening to the stories. Aside from some weird grammar, the stories are interesting. What I don’t like, AT ALL, is sitting through SEVEN ADS to “unlock” another chapter, only to be “given” the chapter that I just listened to!! That’s pretty shady. I will delete the app at the end of this story, if indeed I can even make it to the end. The only reason I even gave three stars instead of one is the story itself."

"Been using the app semi regularly for a few months now and enjoy the stories, but since the latest update with the GUI revamp I’ve been having problems with the stories auto pausing randomly.  It’ll play for 30-45 sec and then pause.  Hit play to get a few more sentences and it pauses again.  Borderline unusable now."

This is a good app to listen to stories overall
"I like the app and most of the stories I listen to on a daily basis. The few things I don’t like have to do with the sleep timer feature. When I want to stop at the end of the episode I’m currently listening to it doesn’t stop and continues onto the next episode depending on which series I’m listening to. I also don’t like the 15 minute increments to stop listening, it would be better if I could say I wanted to stop after 2 or 3+ episodes instead."

Makes me not want to listen and some of us cannot afford to keep spending money on coins that cost 8 coins per episode to unlock. Burns through coins way to fast. Money hungry app."

Don’t get sucked into the diamond tier level bonus program.
I moved all the way up to the diamond tier. Wanting those juicy rewards unfortunately within a couple weeks I found out that if you don’t continue spending the obscene amount that they want you lose your status and get no additional bonuses even though I made it to diamond tier. I think I’ve spent about $1000 to get to diamond to level maybe a little bit more. I’d have to go back through my purchases but I made two purchase at the $99 tier level today and neither one of them gave my bonuses so I went through all the information that they had and I discovered that if you don’t continue paying the same amount that they take away your level and your bonuses. I think on the diamond level you got to maintain that amount you gotta buy about $500 worth of coins to maintain it. The developer should be ashamed of their greed.

Worse app
They will force you to pay for the ending of the book don’t waste your time unless you ok to spend about $40 to finish the book. Also during the book they change the cost everyday for the next 10 min section. So when or if you do spend money on the book they charge more the more you spend. For a ok book I have spent over $80 bucks and the chapters kept increasing.

"Your app doesn’t give any free episodes. I’m told I can watch 24 ads for two episodes, only the two episodes never come. This happens day after day. We’re supposed to get three free episodes each day. Never get them. Lucky to get one new episode. Then have to watch numerous ads to supposedly get two episodes / never get them. Watching these numerous ads only gets owner of app ad revenue. Pretty slick scam. After putting up with this scam awhile, I finally deleted this fake app. Just not worth it. I’ll order the audio online."

Great Stories but…
"The stories are great. They’ve got some amazing people who write them and audio quality for most stories is quite good. I’ve been listening for several months now and a few stories I listen to on a daily basis and they are great. However, the coins are ridiculously expensive and the fact That they show ads constantly while trying to listen to stories after spending a ridiculous amount on coins is shameful. I would be OK with the coin prices being the way they were, but the fact that the ads constantly pop up ruins the experience. If they removed the ads mid story, I would consider giving them a five star review since everything else has been quite nice. If you took the time to read this and you’re a new listener, I recommend my vampire system. Absolutely amazing. At the end of the day, the story quality makes the app worth it. The ads are a large blemish."

I really enjoyed My vampire system. The story is great but the app is an absolute joke. DO NOT buy coins or use this app. Sadly they own the rights to the book now and you can find parts of it on Amazon music and couple other sites but they have taken down the full version. Unless you want to drop 3 grand on listening to a book try and find a different site.

BEWARE SCAM
"Beware inputting your information anywhere !! Don’t buy coins until Devs fix pricing and moderate third party survey corps. Not to mention most of the surveys DON’T WORKSome of the stories around your favorite genres are captivating, but the coins are very expensive, developers know this and use this to motivate you to earn “free” coins by completing surveys, some of which asking you to input your Social Security (SSN) and other sensitive info.As they give you a ton of coins on your first $1, they further tempt you to spend upwards of $50 for a full audiobook, Or you can complete dangerous surveys for a generous amount of free coins. very malicious tactic.Kids and young teens use apps like these more and more, and these Developers are putting their own greed above public safety."

Limited episodes
This app was very god the first few weeks I got it I was listening to my book which is called my dragon princes and I’ve really liked it they give you around 36 episodes free before having to wait for episodes every day at first it started with 5-6 episodes a day which isn’t bad at all since you can also watch adds for coins and they give you a coin deal which I so worth it it’s one dollar for like 400 coins but all of a sudden these past two days they been giving me 2 episodes a day and they even made me wait 48 hours so I didn’t even get any free episodes today which is very disappointing since I was actually liking this app a lot and going to give a positive review one I finished my book this is really disappointing to me I hope they fix this because they didn’t even warn me that my episodes a day would get cut short by almost 75% and making me wait double the time for only 2 episodes I would really appreciate if you could return it back to 5 episodes and I know I wouldn’t be the only one happy and grateful about that change so please consider it. Thank you

The worst app a person can download
"Here is why:  so you hear about this app from a friend or so and they told you it’s amazing. The sound effects is okey and the story telling is kinda good but not that good that you need a small fortune to listen to a full story.So at the beginning, they lure you in it’s like a gambling machine they give you the first hundred chapters or so for free after that they will ask you to buy coins for the fraction of a price and you will get like 400 of them and you will think to yourself, yeah that’s cheap I could do that.And there where they will gets you in their nets because after you spend your 400 coins you will get only two chapter for free and then after that every chapter would cost you around a dollar or so and and every story there it has at least 700 chapters.I made the mistake and I don’t want you to do the same just don’t get attached and read the novel with your own voices and imagination.."

Money Grab
"There’s a lot of decent story’s to listen to. Some stories are great but terrible to listen to because the narrator is bad or the music is too loud.My big issue is the coin base. You can buy coins to unlock episodes in advance which is a great for their market. However, the coin will Auto Unlock episodes that you don’t want to spend on. The coin price increase for very new episode you unlock so auto unlocking episodes without any warning just loses its potential to listen to the other stories you want to catch up on. It’s simply foul play and that’s why I stop buying coins. Not worth it."

Hook line and sinker
First time user.  Started listening to “My Vampire System”. The audio is alright.  Narrator tries to make voices for different characters but at points it’s so bad that you can’t help but laugh.  The story so far is good…. But the real issue is the pay to listen system. I’ve spent $20 and I’m at episode 341.  There are something like 2200+ episodes.   I don’t think $120+ is worth listening to the story.   What is that….like 5x the price of an actual book?

No customer consideration
I spent $330 buying episodes of My Vampire System (episode 1-1717). Each episode came with pictures and illustrations until I reached episode 1718. At that point all remaining episodes had no pictures or illustrations. PocketFM support says they’re an  audio only product and do not intend to illustrate the remaining episodes. This was never disclosed to me. This makes the series useless to me.

The app is great except…
I got hooked on Pocket FM when I learned about My Vampire system. Which is great by the way. I hope the writer continues it soon. And I been hooked up pocket fm ever since. It’s great on my way in to work and long drives. The problem is with the need for coins which there are options to get free coins by watching ads. However they recently added free coins just for coming onto the app daily. Which is great I thought. Until the other day life got busy and my only opportunity to listen to my story which is now infinite mana in the apocalypse… was while i was driving. But I did not get the notice that I wont get credit for the stream unless I open the app in my phone. I opened the app through my car and the next day it said my streak ended. I’m highly upset about this.

Narrators
I’ve grown to love some of the narrator voice and style of narration. But when you’re 170 plus episodes into an audio series and they swap a narrator out from some one who reads like an adult to someone who’s over enthusiastic about everything and sounds like they’re reading you a kids book. Then I have a serious problem. I honestly want a refund because I wouldn’t have wasted money on a jobel that does this. I’m extremely annoyed. Shame on these ppl and honestly $30 for a mediocre day worth of listening to an idiot series partially is not good.

Liars
"They hook you up to listen to this story. I absolutely hate it when this stupid cheerful voice tells you that this is the last free episode, come for more free episodes tomorrow. So, tomorrow comes… there are no new episodes. Then the day after tomorrow comes and there are no new episodes and the same cheerful, stupid voice says: “come back tomorrow.” By the way, it happens quite often?"

"The new episodes have been saying “unlocked in 48 hours” since early this morning. I would expect those hours to decrease each time I check it, but they have not. I’ve spent money on this app. I will delete if the free episode countdown doesn’t move."

Unjust costs
"I love the books, but the sheer costs of the books is getting quite outlandish. The constant need to purchase coins just to keep the story going is becoming cumbersome. The daily coin option is not worth it because it’s not even enough to purchase one episode. The options to earn free coins sends you through a rigmarole, just to not get anything in return. At this point I’m better off reading the book versus listening to it."

Content is great. Cost is terrible rip off
My exposure to pocket fm was after getting other audiobooks from audible and apple book. I was lured into pocket fm by the great content from my vampire system. That’s when it all went downhill.. the costs are a rip off a single story if purchased to completion is a few hundred dollars.. I took a deal with a coin bonus thinking wow this should cover a couple stories..   nope.. ran out pretty quickly. Then I thought.. well it can’t possibly be much more… wrong again.. love the story but pocket fm is a ripoff

Too many ads
"This was a good platform to listen to a book even though you only get a couple of episodes a day. However - now there’s an add in every episode it’s annoying.Sometimes I pay to unlock episodes or re-listen to episodes, but with all the ads, I may just finish the current book and decline listening in the future.  The adds are louder than the book and just a lot of noise that when you have a headset on, it blows out the ear. Very disturbing."

Needs a few tweaks
"There are entertaining stories on this app, but it could use a few tweaks. Tokens are used automatically, which drives me nuts. You should be able to toggle coin use, by story and cost. Stories should also show if there are any available free stories, so you don’t have to constantly check them."

Amazing
It’s a great app with amazing stories on it. The only downside is how much an episode cost after you get through the free episodes for the day. Only thing I could think that would make it better is if there was a way to just buy the series so you don’t have to wait 2 years to listen to one or spend 200$

Empty out your wallet
First off the story’s in this app are pretty decent but the catch is that you’ll be dropping a mortgage payment on just one full series alone if it’s over 1000 episodes long. They start out not to bad but the coin amount per episode after a while is absurd  10+ for just one episode! But after some internet looking you definitely can find the yo ho versions of all their popular series

When I first listened to audiobooks I was fine with the ads being in low quantity but now they’re becoming too frequent making it harder to enjoy. Can you add the ability to watch a set amount of ads 10 or so for 1 day of no ads or make us pay $15ish for no ads permanently because they’re getting out of hand getting 2 ads for every 12 minute episode

Good Stories - App is a Scam
"The story is good, but the app is way too expensive. At first, you get some free episodes, but if you want to keep listening throughout the day without waiting, you’ll have to pay for additional chapters. It’s not cheap, and the costs add up really fast.On top of that, the app isn’t reliable. Sometimes when I log back in, it takes me back to the previous chapter but still charges me for the next one, even though I already finished it. I tried contacting customer support about this issue, but there’s no way to actually get a hold of anyone, so you’re basically stuck with the problem.I’m still listening for now because I enjoy the story, but once I’m done, I’ll be deleting the app."

Tap joy/Offerwall - PREDATORY SCAM!!!!!
"Pocket FM is fine, but their partner Tapjoy who runs their free coins promo , Offer wall, is a predatory & illegal scam!  The offer was to play a game to make coins at certain milestones & I was lured in by collecting few coins for the first 4 milestones.  But when I reached the major 1650 coin milestone, they mysteriously claimed that I violated some terms & conditions.  If that were true, why wasn’t I notified before investing 30 days into this game?  And therein lies the fraud! I’m sure they got paid for sending me to that game, but when it came time to reward me, I was cheated!  After complaining about the verdict, I was sent a not so subtle threat to stop complaining, “That email was a notice, not a suspension of your account….”If this is the kind of con their partner is running, I’ll be using up the coins I actually paid for & finding another app for my series."

Mixed Results
"The stories themselves are really good however, the way they are unlocked overtime becomes worse and worse, so you have to wait longer and longer to listen to each episode. It goes from being able to listen to 8 for free every day to 3 and I assume in time it’ll probably even drop to less than that. The eight per day is a good balance anything less than that is forcing people to have to spend money to try and listen to episode. And watch one ad to unlock one episode"

Inconsistent
"Update it’s even worst than I thought. Some days they give you only 1 episode. And the next one won’t be available for 48 hours. How long do they expect a person to finish a 2k episode series when they can only watch 1 episode a day. This is scamming…While I do enjoy the app, I can only enjoy in batches. I have unlocked so many episodes and it will be there one minute and if I go back in an hour it tells me it’s not available until the next day. I strategically unlocked hundreds of episodes without listening to the story, one day when I was about half way through the unlocked episodes, I logged out. When I came back it said what was once unlocked wasn’t available until 48 hours. That’s also another issue, it will tell you anywhere from 10 hours and then will change to 48. It is not fair that the app is inconsistent and the efforts people put in are taking away. Once I finish the series I have already started, which seems like it’ll take another 6 months, I will be deleting the app. It’s not worth it the little bit of episodes they allot a day will make it take at least 3-6 months to finish a series if you don’t want to spend for coins."

Good but predatory
"I got this app a couple of weeks ago. At first, I was wondering why I was allowed to listen to so much of the story, The soul of a warrior, u til I reach episode 47. From then, I either had to wait a day for new episodes, or pay. I've put about $20 in the app so far, and I'm not completely impressed. After a couple of weeks, I've noticed the price for episodes increase. I went from getting 4-5 episodes a day, ti only 1 or 2. I understand the author uses this as a form of money. But why not lock it at 4-5 episodes a day? The app is essentially strong-arming me to spend money, or painstakingly listen to the story 2 episodes a day.  What also bothers me, is that there's no option to just buy the story outright. I'd be happy for stuff like $45 for the complete story... but the amount of coins you get per payment, leaves you feeling more scammed than ever. Fantastic stories, super predatory app."

Ads
"Since I started getting ads, I got less episodes unlocked per day! Went from 5 episodes a day (enough for round trip commute) down to 2 enough for one way only... seems like a new way to try and force people to buy coins. All the while throwing ads in as a double down to make more money"

Money hungry
"This app used to be amazing, 2 free episodes every day and you could listen to 5 or 6 after that for one coin. But now absolutely awful, 1 episode every 48 hours, 3 episodes for 1 coin and then 7 coins after that OH AND ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EPISODES!!!!! I really want to finish My Vampire System but I think at this point I may just buy the books and read them myself. They’re only 15 bucks for the entire line. It’s terrible how money hungry the devs got with this app."

Crazy
"Some of the stories on this app are genuinely very good, and I appreciate that much of the content can be enjoyed for free. However, the coin system feels like a total rip-off if you decide to purchase coins to continue listening. Episodes may start at 5 coins, but then suddenly increase to 10, 12, and eventually even 20 or more coins per episode. That pricing structure feels unfair and misleading. I could understand a flat cost of 5 coins per episode, but constantly raising the price the further you get into a story makes it frustrating and discouraging to continue."

Happy
I love being able to listen in the car. I can’t do that with a book.  I just wish they would add another way to watch ads to gain coins apart from the ads to unlock 2 episodes. Also now that I’m further along in the series now I have to wait 48 hours for the next episodes to unlock. Why 48 hours? Isn’t 24 hours long enough?

Not as advertised
The stories are good. That is the only reason I gave it the rating I did. But they give you a good long sample (number of episodes) and then lock you down with ads (and only 2/day) or buying coins. So you buy coins and they say “no ads for x# of days (depending on the package you buy) only to find that adds are still required unless you want to use all the coins you just bought. What the purchase gets you is unlimited ads that then start having to watch more and more in order to keep getting them free.

Be careful
"Love the content, but buyer beware.  The app has no good way to stop spending coins when going to next episode.  It autoplays to consume more coins (even if you intended on using coins somewhere else).  The only way to stop it is to use the sleep function, but that has proven unreliable.  It is a trap (of sorts) to force you to get more coins.  I am down about 100 coins at this point, and my success rate at stopping it relies on the sleep function working properly."

Love the application and hate the bugs.
"This app is very generous with listening time and relatively inexpensive when it comes to topping up. However, the drawbacks come in the form of irritating (and sometimes anger-inducing) glitches. The main issue I’ve encountered is being unable to listen to one specific episode that I actually paid for. You can imagine the frustration of being 78 chapters deep, stuck on a cliffhanger, and unable to find out what happens—even though the story is right there in front of you.Support is nonexistent (just a Q&A section in the app), so all you can do is cross your fingers and hope you get lucky. On the bright side, if everything runs smoothly, the voices are great and the stories are genuinely entertaining.Update: I managed to download the episode I needed before switching my device to airplane mode, and it worked! Unfortunately, as soon as my phone reconnected to Wi-Fi, the episode got skipped again."

"Paid for no ads and several months in intrusive ads.  No way to contact company.  Frequently on autopay will restart story requiring me to manually click through to where I am on the story.  Does not allow me to catch on my stories in an efficient manner while driving.  I enjoy some of the stories, despite a significant lack of editing and the voiceover’s being an often in accurate and ranging and quality, but a lot of app features leave a lot to be desired.  The fact that I spent real money getting rid of ads and then they were arbitrarily added back in feels very much like a scam."

Frustrations
"I like to listen to audiobooks while I drive. I have a few on here that I’ve been listening to. The app started off allowing you to listen to a good handful of chapters but then will require you wait 24 hours (or more) for new unlocks or you can buy coins which are unreasonably expensive and would cost more than a physical book if you keep making purchases. You can also watch ads to get coins but after watching several, the coins never appeared in my account. I refuse to pay for coins because of the overall cost for experience so I’ve always waited for the next free chapters to come in. For my current book, the app will not allow me to listen to the final 30 chapters without coins no matter how many days go by claiming to be “climax episodes” - just all the sudden everything I’ve known and have been accustomed to is not an option anymore do I can’t finish the story. It’s really annoying."
"There are a lot of other minor issues with the app itself. For example, sometimes when your free chapters are done and it automatically goes to your next book, it will start you over at episode one or start a whole new book you never selected.Lastly, the quality of the stories are not fantastic. Some are super repetitive and drawn out."

Extremely Expensive much better options elsewhere!!!
I am an avid audible listener I have been for many years now.  I have tried multiple options for platforms just to try them out.  What I have found with this platform is the price is astronomically high.  It’s not an upfront cost it’s the over time that gets you a cut but a thousand knives if you will.  For example the one book I have made it through half of so far even with the discounts has cost me 50 dollars and by the way I am doing the math if I keep my normal listening pace is most likely going to cost me an additional hundred dollars.  Now granted the book I am on is probably a three part series but that still doesn’t offset the enormous cost.  What they do is they sell you coins and give you a couple of free samples then in the evening they charge you coins to continue listening and it averages out to about ten coins every 7 to 8 minutes.  Not all times are I have paid all the way up to 29 coins for ten minutes of listening time.  I would much rather just buy a book no hidden cost no hidden fees just buy and own.  I currently and have been using audible since 2009 and it is a good app and I would and have suggested this app but never stop paying for your subscription because if you do all the books you have bought will be gone.  Plus they don’t have the background music like in the modern books and it does take a while to bring out the next book. If you are looking for an app that makes your feel like you are in a movie try sound booth theatre it’s a great app just not a big selection.  Overall like I have said I have tried many of them I still maintain my audible account and as soon as I finish this book I will make another post saying exactly how much it cost for an avid listener to listen to one book.  Stay tuned I will be back lol.

Rip off
"Pocket FM is one of the most overpriced audiobook platforms I’ve ever tried. They make you either pay outrageous amounts for episodes or watch ads for coins. The catch? You can only watch ads once per day, which means you crawl through the story at a snail’s pace unless you’re willing to fork over huge amounts of money.Do the math: getting through a full-length book could literally cost you over a thousand dollars. That’s insane, especially when other audiobook and podcast services offer unlimited listening for a simple subscription.The stories may be good, but the platform is clearly designed to squeeze as much money as possible from listeners. Between the ridiculous pricing model, the limited ad rewards, and the constant paywalls, Pocket FM feels more like a cash grab than an entertainment app.Save your time and money — there are much better (and fairer) alternatives out there."

"$2,296 USD to listen to “My Vampire System”  as of August 24, 2025"
"I really want to enjoy this app, I like the stories, but this is unacceptably expensive. $39.99 gets 400 coins or roughly $0.10 per coin. Each episode cost 7 to 10 coins (depending on some unknown metric) and most often the higher end. There are 2,296 episodes. Let’s be honest, the system is not going give you seven cents listening, you’ll be closer to the $.10 per episode, so to complete this series at the moment it will cost you $2,296. I tried to use one of the “get free listens if you complete this” it was so focused on if my heritage was Latin American or if I was not heterosexual the system kicked me out. I really want to recommend this as the app so much fun but this is just outrageous gouging."

My Review
"The progress is noticeable, and it's great to see improvements being made in the storytelling.However, there's still room for enhancement, particularly in terms of versatility and character diversity within the narratives.While the voice acting is showing some progress, it could benefit from a wider range of male and female voices to enrich the overall experience.""My Three Vampire Wives"" remains my favorite story, showcasing good versatility, but it, like others, could still use some additional work in these areas.Overall, the effort put into these stories is appreciated, and I encourage you to keep up the good work as you continue to develop and refine them!"

Great stories but way expensive!!!!
I have loved listening to the stories. The app is great and I enjoy listening to unwind or while doing tasks. The biggest issue is after you listen to several free episodes and are invested in the story they begin requiring coins. You can play games to earn coins but most give very few (like 1 per play) and an episode may require 17 coins. I have purchased coins but can’t justify continuing to do it so after my current story is done I will delete my app. This is the only story app I’ve owned so I hate I can’t continue to use it but it’s greedy how much you have to pay/ do to enjoy the stories.

Free with ads
"I do enjoy listening to the stories, I will say that the writer of “Alpha’s Bride” uses the same words over, and over, and over. Embody is one of the favorites."
I will not spend money on this because I feel that the app is subpar at best.
"So of course I watch ads for free episodes. After watching first one ad for a free chapter, then you watch two ads for a free episode, which then jumps to 8 ads for two free episodes. As well as waiting 24 hours for new episodes."
"In the beginning I could space out my day, and get free episodes. Now all of a sudden it’s 48 hours for new episodes. For the last two days I get the message that a free episode will be available in 48 hours. The time is not decreasing. What’s up with that?"

Has become an ad overload
The good:
Don’t believe the cringy ads you see everywhere for My Vampire System. It’s an interesting fusion of scifi and gothic fantasy while mixing in so many other ideas from other works. I can’t speak for other series’s on the app but that one continues to exceed my expectations.The bad:
An audio series is broken up into short episodes and you unlock 2 episodes a day for free with the opportunity to unlock a few more by watching ads or you can pay to unlock more. The exchange rate for money to episodes is awful. I’m not above paying for content. I paid about $30 for what I expected to be about an audiobook equivalent of episodes but it was far from it. Now I engage in the soul-crushing grind of farming ads for episodes.The ugly:
"To somehow make things worse, they recently added random ads while listening to episodes. It has become a barely tolerable experience. I’m looking forward finishing My Vampire System and being done with this app.Final thoughts:"
It’s wild to me they don’t have an ad-free subscription…. I would gladly pay for a good experience and good content at a reasonable price. Instead they force you into ads and micro transactions…. It’s like Podcasts and Audible had a baby that was raised by an awful free-to-play mobile game.

Plagiarism and 16 adds for 2 episodes
The beginning of the story is plagiarized then goes into an inconsistent weird direction. You have to watch 16 adds for 2 episodes but when you press X to close the add it just keeps popping up so it takes like half a hour of adds to get two episodes.

Very disappointed beware don’t download!
"The audio series I am listening to, the story, is pretty good but they make it difficult to listen to it without buying coins. I have probably spent at least 100. And they keep upping the coin amount that they take from my balance they start to bring it down if you don’t listen,"
"but the worst part is it says 16 adds to open 1 chapter then after I’ve watched several adds it says adds exhausted so I don’t get the adds promised and I don’t get the chapter. When I have coins and try to stop it from playing by hi lighting the button, (stop after this chapter)"
so I don’t use up my last 30 coins it keeps playing automatically.
When I try to communicate to them my issues I either don’t get a response or they tell me I’m not logged in so they can’t help. They have no intention of fixing my issue or compensating me. They don’t care about the listener they just want their money.

3 stars is all you get for now
I like the app but you have to wait too long to unlock more episode. Plus you can only unlock 2 episodes a day now from watching ads. That really sucks. You make it really hard to unlock more episodes. I would rather pay a subscription then pay for coins that only unlocks a couple of episodes

Story’s are good. The app is rough
"I love the story I’m listening to. The problem comes from the app. At first I’d just listen to the few free chapters unlocked each day, but I would be interrupted by 3 ads per 8 min chapter. So I started prewatching a hand full of ads and all that went away. One add unlocked 1 chapter. Ok cool. Then it threw in 2 ads for 2 chapters and every now and then it would be 4 ads for 2 but go back to 1 for 1. Ok cool. I’m about 1/3 through the 2200 chapters and now it expects me to watch 15 ads for 2 chapters. Now it’s not cool. That is ridiculous!!! For me to finish the book I’ll either have to watch 20,250 ads, pay a huge amount of money, or only listen to a couple 8 min chapters a day. Which is what will prob happen. It would be 0 stars if it wasn’t for the fact I like the book so much and they bought the rights to it and I can’t listen anywhere else."

Lies to get you to
Spend. You sign up to and told you get free books but only a few 5-10min chapters. After that you need to watch ads or spend to keep listening /reading.. then I started to notice that it takes all your earned coins for using daily in order to open you free chapters… I also found that this app is using Spotify chapters.. so not even producing its own content.

LONG TEXT BUT NECESSARY It just got worst
I spend 0.99$ for 400 coins then after seen 40 episodes the first day free it gave me a wall saying to continue reading spend 1 coin then 4 then 5 now l have to spend 14-15 coins for 5 mins of audio its bad but thats not the worst part there is no ad  to pay with so if you want to continue hearing you ether pay or wait 24h to see 14 episodes then wait a 24 hours. If this don’t change your mind nothing will.
Part 2: l try the new earn coin website and it reset all of my tabs l lots 200+ tabs with all the manhua l had. I can’t express the anger I am feeling right now. Just to inform

Alpha Bride
I can tell the author is growing and learning with us as the story is unfolding. The writer has a great story to tell I’d really love after many books a revised book and to see it blossom into the magical story I know it could be. The story has great potential. I haven’t given up. Altho repetitive lines seems to be an issue and wasting little free reading time on a lot of fillers. There is so much that could be accomplished with this story. And genre. Good luck

I wish ads to episodes was 1 to 1
The lies pocket fm tell about free episodes everyday are annoying.  They want you buy coins so you don’t know what anything is worth.  A free episode is every 48 hours and they make you watch 8 ads for a single episode.  The fact is pocket fm don’t value you the customer.  But some of the stories are good.  So I guess I will keep wasting my time to not watching the ads for free episodes.

They raise the cost of the episodes and decrease how many coins you get for your money.
"When I first downloaded the app, I assumed I could listen to a story for a reasonable amount of money. I was so wrong. Not only did the original “deal” go away, but the episodes have cost more and more. The first 125 episodes cost $1 for 400 coins. (Approximately—-it lasted 9 days) The next purchase was $20 for 480 coins. This lasted three days. I have since spent $210 over the last eleven days.  I still have over 100 episodes left. The first episodes would cost 6 coins each—-now they cost 19 to 48—they mark through saying they are half off. This is a rip off. Many other options that are cost effective."

Starting over?
I’ve been listening for quite some time now and the one thing I can’t wrap my head around is the fact that although I’m very far into my audiobook it starts from chapter 1 all over again. It’s happened with a few different books. Please fix. It’s annoying to go from chapter 500 back to chapter 1
TIA

Has become an ad overload
The good:
Don’t believe the cringy ads you see everywhere for My Vampire System. It’s an interesting fusion of scifi and gothic fantasy while mixing in so many other ideas from other works. I can’t speak for other series’s on the app but that one continues to exceed my expectations.The bad:
An audio series is broken up into short episodes and you unlock 2 episodes a day for free with the opportunity to unlock a few more by watching ads or you can pay to unlock more. The exchange rate for money to episodes is awful. I’m not above paying for content. I paid about $30 for what I expected to be about an audiobook equivalent of episodes but it was far from it. Now I engage in the soul-crushing grind of farming ads for episodes.The ugly:
"To somehow make things worse, they recently added random ads while listening to episodes. It has become a barely tolerable experience. I’m looking forward finishing My Vampire System and being done with this app.Final thoughts:"
It’s wild to me they don’t have an ad-free subscription…. I would gladly pay for a good experience and good content at a reasonable price. Instead they force you into ads and micro transactions…. It’s like Podcasts and Audible had a baby that was raised by an awful free-to-play mobile game.

"This is a great concept, with a great story. The cost with on sale you can get 80 credits for five dollars when an eight minute section of a book cost 6 to 7 credits that get to be really expensive especially when a book has 2000 chapters. I would much rather pay a monthly fee and have access to all the books than to do with this ridiculous way. Because I refuse to pay that much. I just sit and wait for the time to clear up on a new episode, so I get about a half hour a day to listen."

Pocket FM
"Revision of review : I like the stories however the number of ad that you gotta go through to get to a free episode are ridiculous. The cost of the episodes is also too much. Now, when I watch the ads in order to open the episode, it would say you had to watch a certain number of episodes after you watch those episodes, it would turn around and say you had to watch even more ads to open those episodes. I went in today because. Supposed to have timed out to get free episodes and then it automatically added 12 more hours without even playing an episode. This is completely ridiculous. As much as I would like to finish the story, I am going to delete it because this is entirely too much hassle. Honestly, this thing is ripping me off from the so-called coins that I have and have obtained. if I was not so far into the book, I would just delete the app already. I think this app is somewhat of a scam because it does not give you the coins that you have earned. It just takes them away and says that you have none. If the book was somewhere else, I would be deleting this app and going there, but I cannot find it somewhere else. I guess it won’t do me any good but to only utilize the free episodes which looks to be about every 48 hours. This is a complete scam and totally ridiculous.. I should have been almost done with this book by now based on the number of points that I had supposedly earned which it has deleted. Hope someone else has better luck with it."

Loving the series I am listening to but the further into it the less I get to listen to based on ad demand. Used to watch one ad per extra episode and was granted 4. Now it’s 7 in a row to watch one episode. And that’s with purchasing which is very little reward

It’s A Trap! – Extremely Disappointed
"I downloaded Pocket FM thinking it would be an enjoyable way to experience my favorite web novels, but it turned out to be just another addiction trap. At first, they entice you with free coins and easy access, but once you’re hooked on a story, the costs skyrocket.The coin system is deliberately convoluted. On average, 10 coins only gets you about 10 minutes of content, and with thousands of short episodes, the price adds up insanely fast. I found myself spending $30–$40 a day just to keep listening. That’s not financially responsible or feasible for anyone long-term.To finish a single novel, you could easily spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Meanwhile, a real audiobook of the same length would cost only a fraction of that. The pricing here feels deceptive, unsustainable, and borderline scammy.I’m extremely disappointed. Pocket FM should offer fairer, more transparent pricing—ideally a subscription or full-book unlock instead of this endless microtransaction trap. Until then, I cannot recommend this app (trap) to anyone."

Almost Perfect -Just One Thing Holding It Back
"I fell in love with this app very quickly. The ability to write your own audiobooks and bring your story to life with customizable AI narration and background music is truly amazing.The content on the platform is top-notch exciting, diverse, and always leaves you wanting more.The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the coin system. After getting hooked on a story, you only get about 5 free episodes before you’re required to use coins to continue. It starts off requiring 1–5 coins per episode but quickly ramps up to 10 coins per episode. If you’re not keeping track, it can get expensive fast.I completely understand the need to monetize, and I don’t mind paying for good content but it would be fantastic if there were a monthly subscription option that offered a flat rate or allowed access to more episodes beyond the daily free ones. Or even a flat rate to purchase the whole series!  That would make the experience more accessible and enjoyable for binge listeners like me.Finally, I want to say that this app is incredibly entertaining and creative. One idea for future updates could be the addition of animated, AI-generated videos or images especially with characters whose mouths move in sync with the narration. Something similar to what’s often shown in TikTok ads. While I usually just listen now, I really enjoyed the visuals early on in the series. They helped paint a vivid picture of the characters and setting, which made the story feel even more immersive instead of leaving everything up to imagination.Great job with the app.  I will most definitely continue to be an active part of the community.  Thanks for all that you do!"

Immediate Revision
"I love this app so much. The stories are addictive & amazing! HOWEVER if Pocket FM does not urgently reconsider their marketing strategies when it comes to how consumers are spending their money for these audio stories, I can guarantee you that they will not be around long. For Pocket FM to literally have consumers spend hundreds of dollars on Pocket Coins and then also, risk identity theft through many third party promotional app companies (many, that are not even legit) in order for consumers to retrieve free Pocket Coins (did I mention that it’s not even guaranteed that you will receive those free Pocket Coins?!), is urgently an inconvenience to consumers and eventually this will result in Pocket FM facing consequences financially, when it comes to consumer engagement. There’s absolutely no way in the world that they are refusing considering creating monthly membership packages for consumers to purchase in order to upkeep consumer engagements (unfortunately this is true at this time). It comes off on the organization’s behalf as selfish and them being money hungry. Again; it’s a huge inconvenience to the consumers who are utilizing their services. You can barely enjoy the services at an affordable price without consistently having to pay for pocket coins every other hour!? If Pocket FM doesn’t reconsider AFFORDABLE MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP PACKAGES (with perks included), in the long run they will perish! I’d hate to see because it is a great app but LOGICAL/SENSIBLE, FAIR (AFFORDABLE) AND REASONABLE marketing strategies will need to change if they’re going to be around! It’s a must! 4.5 stars for the app overall. I may reconsider changing this review depending on if the CEO sees my review and actually cares to do something about it soon.Another thing: I have two accounts with you guys; I’ve noticed how one account Pocket Coin packages differs from the other. If you’re going to be anything, U urge you to please refrain from being disloyal to your customers per various accounts. There’s absolutely no way that those Pocket Coin packages should differ in pricing and in quality whatsoever! It’s literally every time you pay for Pocket Coins, that the Pocket Coin packages immediately generate both in quantity and in pricing, resulting in a huge inconvenience. Lastly, my friend has an account as well. When created his account, he immediately has Pocket Streak on his account. We both created for Pocket FM together (same time). With  both of my accounts I do NOT have Pocket Streak. AGAIN; if you have to is daily reward system, then EVERY CUSTOMER should have the eligibility to have access to this perk! Again, a huge inconvenience when it  [review truncated, click ""view"" below to see full content]"

40$/min to finish your Story
Hope your are the style of person not finishing book… because this App do everything they can to encourage you to change book after you have begin one developpe interest. You will need to pay 40$ per minute to continue… or wait 14 hour for 14min free… or give all your personal information to an obscur research on line and maybe you will be able to listen 7 more minutes. Instead the app will suggest to start a new story book…   All the ingredient for a SCAM.

"„Nett gedacht, schlecht gemacht“"
An sich ist die Idee ganz gut. Jedoch gibt es keinerlei „freie“ Audiofolgen mehr. Zu jeder einzelnen Folge muss man sich Werbung anschauen um diese dann hören zu können.
Das ist nervig und nimmt einem die Zeit die man damit verbringen wollte stressfrei dem Alltag kurzzeitig zu entfliehen.
"10 freie Folgen pro Tag wären cool,"
"5 waren grenzwertig aber noch verschmerzbar, inzwischen jedoch nicht mehr vertretbar."
Motto dazu:
"„Nett gedacht, schlecht gemacht“"
-------------------
English Translation
"“Nice idea, poorly executed”"
"The idea itself is quite good. However, there are no longer any ""free"" audio episodes. You have to watch ads for each individual episode to be able to listen to it."
That's annoying and takes away the time you'd want to spend temporarily escaping everyday life without stress.
10 free episodes per day would be cool.
"5 were borderline but still bearable, but now it's no longer justifiable."
The motto:
"""Nice idea, poorly executed."""

A decent app
"Based on my experience so far, Pocket FM is a decent app for listening to audio stories, but there are definitely some areas that could use improvement."
"I've only listened to one book on the app, but the story itself was captivating and the narration was well-done. The app has a wide variety of content, which is a big plus. The user interface is also pretty straightforward and easy to navigate."
"However, a major frustration for me has been the CarPlay functionality. When I'm listening in the car and I press the 10-second skip button, it doesn't move forward by 10 seconds as it should. Instead, it completely skips to the next chapter. This is a significant issue, especially when you just want to quickly jump past a small section and not lose your place in the story. It makes using the app in the car a very clunky and inconvenient experience."
"Overall, the content on Pocket FM is good, but the app's performance, particularly with CarPlay, needs a lot of work. If you're someone who listens to audiobooks while driving, this is a problem that could make you want to look for an alternative."

Shady App with stories written for 16 year olds
"Money grab for ai generated stories that are so so. Deliberate bugs to use coins! For example the sleep function malfunctions constantly in order to use up coins at an unreasonable rate. Long waits for episodes to unlock that inexplicably get extended. Do yourself a favor and don’t bother with the app because the stories are so so at best. If you must, play the long game and wait for the episodes to unlock for free."

Take surveys at your own risk…
"After several emails and request via their app, I still have not received credit for 70 coins for taking two surveys for one of their audio series. They have assured me that they are researching it and will resolve shortly, but this has not happened. It has been over two months and still no coins. How long does it take to review my account and see that you never issued the 70 coins for taking the two surveys? Also, the same is true for the games you play that promise coins play at your own risk.  Again, you do not always get the coins that are promised."

I like it…
I really enjoy the user friendly design. Able to switch between different stories with ease. The stories I’ve started are interesting.
The initial price for purchasing coins is good however after an initial purchase the price gets a little steeper. I would also think maybe adding PayPal as a payment method would make it a little easier to purchase more coins.

"I’ve waited two days to unlock more episodes, and upon returning, I’ve only got the last two episodes I had to watch ads to unlock. What’s more, if you have ANY coins in on your account, the app will charge those instead of asking you to watch an ad, or giving you any more free episodes to watch.

Terrible to listeners
"Around 1/3 the way into a story the 4-5 free daily unlocked episodes stops. It then changes to 1-3 a day. Also multiple times a week it won’t give you any free episodes at all! And that 24h countdown to free episodes just resets itself to 48h!  Frustrating. But you  can watch a bunch of adds every 24h to get 1-3, mostly, usually it’s only 1 or 2 episodes a day when watching adds and that’s it. I found where to directly write in the FAQs to  customer service and wrote multiple times asking why this keeps happening and for help. They do not care. I got the response saying that I must be signed out and THAT was the problem and I needed to sign in and I’d go back to getting all my several a day free episodes again. I immediately checked, I WAS signed in and  I quickly wrote back  asking for more help giving them my account info. I even signed out and in again and nothing helped or got better. I wrote back asking for actual help many times over multiple weeks. I can see my comments are being read but I can’t get any reply at all. Nothing. No one will write back. No help. This app gives you enough of the story to catch your attention and get you interested, then cuts off your free episodes for half the week giving you fake countdowns and extends the 24h over again when they run out. They just want  you to pay for coins to hear the rest of the story. This app is CRAZY expensive for an entire story. You can purchase MULTIPLE (like minimum 8 FULL PRICE) audio books for the price of just one here. Very frustrating. This is a terrible app that treats its users badly"

Frustrated
"Generally easy enough to use. I only listen to approximately 1 or 2 stories on here. My beef comes from there was no function to contact someone about an error unless you gripe about it in a review (Dev I am talking to YOU). Make a contact help function, also the timer does not function properly. The story I listen to has over 2000 episodes and I have not reached ep 1000 yet. Generally it tells you the next couple of free episodes are available in 24 hours and the next set in 48 hours. The timer does not function correctly. I try to listen to my story every day at the same time however, like today, I have to wait an additional 12 hours and even then I am not sure if it will be available. I have bought coins before but the story I like to listen to eats up coins very quickly. I can afford that. I even tried to save some episodes to listen to for a long trip I took and figured they would be available when I drove. They were not. It was disheartening to say the least, I had to wait an additional lot while I was on my trip driving. Fix this please…"

Good app and stories but….
"I really like the stories and I find that I just want to listen all day and the app is user friendly but it states that you can watch ads and play games to unlock new episodes only, it doesn’t give you a way to do that. I find that I am just dumping money into it every day, just to get a couple of episodes."
"It kind of ruins the experience for me. I’ve already spent far more than I’m really comfortable spending. Really wishing there was a way to make this better. Sadly, I may stop using the app for that reason alone."

My Vampire system
Great App a little laggy at times but I will say the coin prices are ridiculous which makes the desire to want to continue reading minimal. I’m $100 dollars into a story and it’s looking like another $1000 to finish. I understand monetizing and free cap but think of the readers.

Pure Greed!
"Honestly, the pricing model ruins the whole experience. The coin system feels predatory—costs rise so quickly that finishing a single story can end up costing dozens or even hundreds of dollars. Some reviewers say they’ve gone from paying about $1 for 3–4 episodes to suddenly $1 per episode, each only 7 minutes long. That’s a very greedy approach and makes the app feel more like a money trap than an entertainment platform.Please rethink this model. A fair, transparent system—like a fixed price per full story or a reasonable monthly subscription—would make Pocket FM worth recommending. Right now, the greed overshadows the great content. One star is probably too generous!"

Foul Language. I’ve listened to several of the stories and the foul language is getting worse. It’s unacceptable and I refuse to give any more time to an app that sees this as acceptable. The low standards of the creators of the stories and this app are very disappointing.

Mixed emotions
"I found the book that I really liked got into it and then of course the app changes to where you have to either pay or you can only read one chapter a day.If you go onto the app every day, it’s says that you’re accumulating coins every day and that will help you read more chapters, but for some reason, the coins are never there and it’s almost like it’s not actually collecting. I thought when it said the app was free that it truly meant free and that you would just have to watch ads if you wanted to listen to more chapters."

Expensive & Time Consuming
"I had listened to over 300 episodes of “My Vampire system” saw there was 2000 left to finish the book. I spent $30  calculating the amount of coins needed to finish the series based upon the average 6 coin per episode and occasional 9-10. Got to episode 470 and ran out of coins. The price of the episodes goes up the more you listen to the books and they auto play so you don’t know how much the cost is rising. They are now 12, 15, 21, 18, 15 and so on. 2-3x the original cost of episodes. It’s cost me $40 total to reach episode 470, not even 1/4 the total of episodes which is 2296. That’s about $10 per 100 episodes including the free episodes I listed too. So they want what? $230+ to finish the series? Could buy the entire “17-19 book series “The Wheel of Time” for less than that."

Good stories BUUUUT
"The stories are good, they def get you hooked… but after a while, they get longer with a lot of fluffy filler episodes that make you spend a lot of coins to continue listening. A regular book might be $25-30 but listening to some of the stories here will need you to pay &12.99 for maybe 5 episodes if you’re lucky. Either get rid of the filling episodes that makes you think it’s an entirely different story or bring the coins cost down cause I’m gonna be done with this app"

Be VERY Careful With Purchases
I have been making purchases for coins to listen to a series I liked. I had put so much money in I got to Gold Pro. When I was going to put more money on it promised an extra 240 coins for the Gold Pro. Once I topped up they never credited me my 240 and they do not have a good customer support. It’s a bot that says hi then say you aren’t logging in and keeps closing the chat.

When I first got this app ages ago I would have given it a 5 star review no question. But this latest update with all the ads across the screen that cut into the story are getting to be too much. It almost makes listening impossible. I have spent $ on many of the stories because they are so good but now….

I do enjoy the story it’s just over time they’ve made it harder and harder to get through the stories continuously moving the goal post back were if you want a complete story been prepared to spend over a thousand for it and it’s not worth it at that point. They have been removing free ways to gain coins so you have to come out of pocket. The pocket in pocket fm stands for them trying to reach into your pockets deep

Disappointing scam of an app
I have been using pocket fm and the price for a single book equates to thousands of pounds and is absolutely extortionate. The coin system is simply a joke. The amount each book seems to vary up to around 30 coins an episode.They offer “free” coins by completing tasks for free coins and do not reimburse coins because they advise you have somehow “breaking a terms of service”.

Expensive short chapters
"Don’t download, it’s just cash grab scheme. They give you limited number of free chapters( called episodes in the app) then you either have to wait until the next day pay ridiculous prices for app coins to purchase episodes. They also include very descriptive as well useless details to draw out the episodes play time, that almost forces you to buy more coins so you can finish one scene in the audio series. It’s like a streaming service, but they cut the entire content of one episode into 10 episodes."

Lags
"They start off as great stories.... But every time I reach chapter 100 on nearly any story, the app cuts out and I can’t listen. I can close and reopen the app, and I can listen for maybe 2 minutes at the most before it cuts off again. I’m writing this review only to let the next person about issues they may experience once they reach chapter 100 on any story. I’ve wasted too much time trying to get a full story, and the app just won’t let it happen. I’ve spent 3 days trying to listen to chapter 107 and still haven’t gotten to listen to the full chapter because the app keeps cutting me off. This is the only app I’ve ever had that does this. No.. it’s not my internet. My internet is top notch and none of my other apps cut off like this one does. I’ve even read other peoples comments within the app who are frustrated as they too are experiencing the same thing. This app is the biggest let down!"

Good story but ridiculously priced
"You only get a couple free episodes per day, each of which last 6-9 minutes. After that you must purchase coins to keep listening. The longer you listen, the more coins required. There is no way to purchase a series outright. The story I’m listening to now has 2,296 episodes. At 3 free per day, it would take 765 days to listen to them all. Or I would have to pay thousands of dollars to get enough coins. The least the app could do is allow for the purchase of an entire series…"

A lot of AI trash and some really good stories
"There are some amazing stories here like Shadow Slave or Spirit Realm Walker that are beautifully narrated and immersive. I’ll find myself completely hooked and on the edge of my seat. However way too many stories are read by AI voices that are painfully lifeless and there’s not an easy to use search function where you can choose fantasy genre and sort by reviews or simply FILTER OUT AI VOICES. I spend so much time just skipping around and listening to the first few seconds of stories, hoping it’s not another robotic voice. I’ll keep listening because there are some really well done stories, but geez, it’s exhausting trying to find them."

Good stories / poor pricing
"I am enjoying the story I have been listening to. However the pricing, the auto pay for chapters and the fact a chapter is only 6-10 min is a bit of a disappointment. The book I’m listening to has 2000+ chapters and if you buy credits they auto spend them as you listen without any notification that you are spending. They will just let you spend everything you purchased and never get a notice of how much or how often. With chapters opening up on a time based basis you sometimes spend and other times don’t spend but not having a clue what or when. I’ll probably finish my story as I’m vested but will delete the app afterwards because it quickly turns into a money grab. I can see charging per book but not per chapter."
